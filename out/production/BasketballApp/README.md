Basketball Scorekeeping App: Event Charting by Location
1. Event Charting with Named Locations
Instead of using a graphical interface to select positions on the court, users will manually select from a list of predefined court locations to track shot attempts and other events. This approach simplifies user interaction and ensures quicker input during a fast-paced game.
Predefined Court Locations
•	Top of the Key: Central area near the three-point line.
•	Left Wing: The area to the left of the key, inside the three-point line.
•	Right Wing: The area to the right of the key, inside the three-point line.
•	Left Corner: The corner near the baseline on the left side of the court.
•	Right Corner: The corner near the baseline on the right side of the court.
•	Baseline (Left/Right): The area under the basket, on both sides of the court.
•	Free Throw Line: The area in front of the basket where free throws are taken.
Users will select one of these predefined locations to log the shot or event (e.g., a missed or made shot).
 
2. Event Types to Chart
Each event (such as a shot attempt or assist) will be recorded with the following key details:
•	Player Name: Identify the player responsible for the action (e.g., shot attempt, assist).
•	Event Type: Select the type of event (e.g., shot made, shot missed, assist, foul).
•	Court Location: Choose from the predefined court locations where the event occurred (e.g., “left corner” for a shot).
•	Shot Outcome: Record whether the shot was made or missed.
Example Event Types
•	Shot Made (2-pointer, 3-pointer, or free throw)
•	Shot Missed
•	Assist
•	Rebound (Offensive/Defensive)
•	Foul (Personal/Technical)
 
3. User Interface for Charting Events
The user interface will be simple and easy to navigate on a tablet, allowing quick access to the predefined court locations for each event. This will ensure that users can efficiently chart events during a live game without the need for complex interactions.
Step-by-Step Interaction Flow:
1.	Select Player: From a list of team members, choose the player involved in the event.
2.	Choose Event Type: Select the event type from a dropdown or button options (e.g., shot attempt, assist, rebound).
3.	Select Location: Choose the location from a list of predefined court zones (e.g., "Left Wing" or "Top of the Key").
4.	Input Outcome: For shot-related events, specify whether the shot was made or missed.
Example Interface Design:
•	Top Section: List of players for easy selection.
•	Middle Section: Event type buttons (e.g., Shot Made, Shot Missed, Rebound, Assist).
•	Bottom Section: Dropdown or list for selecting predefined court locations.
This layout ensures that users can quickly input relevant information during gameplay without being overwhelmed by complex graphical elements.
 
4. Customization for Different Game Styles
•	Different Court Sizes/Settings: The app will allow for easy adjustments based on different court layouts (e.g., high school vs. NBA vs. FIBA).
•	Customizable Locations: For more flexibility, coaches or users can add additional court locations or customize existing ones (e.g., “mid-range left” or “elbow”).
 
5. Post-Game Reporting and Analysis
Once the game is completed, users will be able to analyze the data based on the predefined court locations:
•	Shot Charts: Display the number of shot attempts and makes from each location (e.g., how many shots were made from the left wing).
•	Player Performance by Location: Show shooting percentages for each player from various court zones.
This data will provide coaches and players with valuable insights into shot efficiency and game performance, helping to inform strategies for future games.
